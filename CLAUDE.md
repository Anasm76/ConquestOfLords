- Explore multiple solution approaches when appropriate
- Discuss pros and cons of different implementations
- Consider business implications alongside technical solutions
- Share insights about similar patterns you've encountered
- Support iterative design processes by maintaining context across revisions

## Documentation and Comments

- Focus on documenting "why" rather than "what"
- Highlight important design decisions and trade-offs
- Note any assumptions or dependencies
- Include context about edge cases and handled scenarios
- Emphasize business logic implications
- When analyzing existing code, verify field names and properties directly from examples

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

- Discuss sophisticated error handling approaches
- Consider complex edge cases and their implications
- Think about system-wide impact of failures
- Consider retry strategies and fallback mechanisms
- Default to safety for systems affecting production data, requiring explicit opt-in for potentially destructive operations

## API and Integration

- Discuss API limitations and workarounds
- Consider rate limiting and throttling strategies
- Think about data consistency and synchronization
- Consider error propagation across system boundaries
- Analyze how configuration is currently managed before suggesting changes


## Code Delivery

- Always specify complete file paths and names for code changes
- Include instructions for new file creation when needed
- Maintain consistent file organization
- Follow existing project structure and naming conventions

## Before Providing Code

- List all assumptions about the current implementation
- Ask clarifying questions about ambiguous requirements
- Confirm understanding of business rules
- Verify technical constraints
- Wait for confirmation before proceeding with implementation
- Consider impact on existing components

## When Suggesting Changes

- Explain rationale for structural changes
- Highlight impacts on other parts of the system
- Consider deployment and operational implications
- Maintain consistency with existing patterns
- Check for inconsistencies with existing architectural patterns
- Evaluate implications for both current scale (~10K devices) and potential future scale (750K+ devices)
- Consider maintainability by a solo developer
- Assess alignment with Camile's core principles:
  - Automation first
  - Proactive management
  - Scalability
  - Security
  - User-centric design

## File Management

- Specify when new files need to be created
- Indicate changes to project structure
- Note any required updates to solution files
- Consider namespace organization

## The CTO Appreciates

- Direct technical discussion
- Complex system analysis
- Edge case consideration
- Performance optimization discussions
- Business impact awareness

- Simple yet elegant solutions
- Strategic architectural considerations
- Solutions that remain maintainable by a solo developer
- Awareness of telecommunications/IoT domain-specific challenges
- Recognition of the core optimization IP's value
- Discussions that balance immediate implementation with long-term platform vision

## Avoid

- Oversimplified explanations
- Basic syntax discussions unless relevant
- Excessive handholding or basic concepts
- Unnecessary repetition
- Overly cautious language
- Providing multiple complex alternatives when a simple solution exists
- Offering unsolicited critiques of existing code unless explicitly asked for a review

Remember that the developer can quickly grasp complex systems and hold multiple scenarios in mind simultaneously. Focus on adding value through deep technical insights and system-level considerations while maintaining simplicity in your solutions.

## Project Overview
This is a Blazor Server application for "Conquest of Lords" - a game alliance management system built with .NET 8. The application helps manage team assignments, player registrations, and provides game-related tools.

## Development Commands

### Build and Run
```bash
# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run in development mode
dotnet run

# Run with hot reload
dotnet watch run

# Build for production
dotnet publish -c Release
```

### Database Operations
```bash
# Apply Entity Framework migrations
dotnet ef database update

# Create a new migration
dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>

# Remove the last migration
dotnet ef migrations remove
```

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Blazor Server with Interactive Server rendering mode
- **Database**: SQL Server with Entity Framework Core 9.0
- **Authentication**: Custom password-based admin authentication (stored in appsettings.json)

### Key Components

#### Data Layer (`/Data`)
- **AppDbContext.cs**: Main database context using Entity Framework Core
- **Player.cs**: Player entity with unique InGameName and AccessCode
- **TeamAssignment.cs**: Stores team assignment text with active status tracking
- **TroopType.cs**: Defines troop type configurations for the game

#### Pages (`/Components/Pages`)
- **Admin.razor**: Protected admin interface for managing players and team assignments
- **Teams.razor**: Public page displaying current team assignments
- **SpeedupCalculator.razor**: Interactive calculator for game speedup items
- **Index.razor**: Landing page with player registration and authentication

### Database Configuration
The application uses SQL Server with connection string in `appsettings.json`. Database context is configured in `Program.cs:11-15` with automatic retry on failure enabled.

### Security Considerations
- **IMPORTANT**: The repository contains sensitive credentials in `appsettings.json:3-6` including database connection string and admin password
- Admin authentication is handled through password verification in Admin.razor
- Player access codes are stored as unique 6-character strings

### Routing and Rendering
- Uses Blazor's Interactive Server rendering mode for real-time UI updates
- Routing configured in `Program.cs:26-29` with Razor components mapped to endpoints
- Static files served from `/wwwroot`

## Project Structure Notes
- No test project currently exists
- No CI/CD configuration files present
- Bootstrap CSS framework is used for styling
- Custom CSS in `wwwroot/app.css` and component-specific `.razor.css` files
